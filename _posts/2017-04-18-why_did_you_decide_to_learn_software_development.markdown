Today marks the 1 month mark since I started learning software and web development, and I feel like it's about time that I share why began on this journey. 

I had recently graduated from University with a Bachelors in Civil Engineering and minors in economics and environmental engineering. Throughout my undergraduate degree I have also had the opportunity to interned/worked under different settings, including oil & gas, finance, retail and academic research. Despite the plethora of experiences, I hadn't encountered something specific that I have a driving passion for. I liked and enjoyed specific aspects of all of them but am uncertain about committing my life to one.

In the end, I turned down a couple of other great opportunities and joined Flatiron School because I felt that knowing how to code is likely the most applicable and most versatile set of skills. It allows you to build things as one man or as a team, and the things you can build is endless.

So far, I am enjoying the learning and challenges everyday and had kept up with it. It is very exciting to finally understand how many of the services we use day to day are built and how they fit together. I am excited to see where these new skills can take me and what I will be able to accomplish with them in the future.
