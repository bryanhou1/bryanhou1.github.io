I have finally finished my sinatra app project and the process was definitely more drawn out than I expected it to be.

During this project, I faced a few troubles along the way. To start, I didn't fully plan out what the web app should look like and how it should function. I had a generic idea that I wanted to build a court booking site that would allow the users make reservations for specific one out of multiple courts (ie. Tennis court, Badminton etc.) However, prior to starting, I had not planned out the more intricate details such as how to display the information. I figured that I would just go about it and everything will just fall into place. It's probably obvious by now that was not what had happened. As I begin to build the app, I quickly lost track of what I was doing as I was thinking about many different things at once (ie. the views and how I should store information). On top of that, as I was still new with Sinatra and the lack of familiarity definitely added to the headache. As this is a demo project and can be as fancy as we desire, new functionality ideas also keep coming up and became distraction to the important task at hand of having something working. Eventually I did comb out the details but it definitely took way longer than it should've if I considered and planned out the details first.

Additionally I did not approach the app building process with a test driven approach, since we were not asked to do so. I figured that writing tests will take a long time. Since it was a simple app I was building I thought I can keep track of what I am doing fairly easily. Again, I was wrong. I certainly ended up getting the app to function the way I wanted, but between fixing bugs and checking for edge cases I would have defintely been more efficient by following a TDD approach and probably resulted with more robust codes as well.

Nevertheless, the app was a good learning experience and through it I definitely gained alot of knowledge regarding DateTime, Time, and Date objects and gained good practice using the MVC structure.

The app is here for anyone that is interested: https://github.com/bryanhou1/court-booking-system

Please don't hesitate to give me any feedbacks/criticisms !
